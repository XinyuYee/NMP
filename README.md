# NMP: Neighborhood Manifold Preserving Matching for Visual Place Recognition
This is code for neighborhood manifold preserving matching, which is used for geometric verfication of the visual place recognition system.
The code requires [VLfeat](https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat) to build the initial neighborhoods.
